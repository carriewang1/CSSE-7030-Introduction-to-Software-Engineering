In this assignment, I implemented a text-based version of the classic Sudoku puzzle. The Sudoku puzzle is set on a 9 × 9 board which is split into nine 3 × 3 squares. To achieve the goal of the puzzle, a player must use a process of elimination to fill in the remaining empty cells on the board, using only the digits 1 - 9, so that each row, column and 3 × 3 square only contain one of each digit.

This assignment is to create a Garden Gnome a single-player simulator game where a player must take care of house plants for 15 days. The player must keep more than half their plants alive for this duration. Items are rewarded throughout the day to assist the player and are applied when needed.
