# CSSE-7030-Introduction-to-Software-Engineering
This course introduces fundamental concepts in software engineering, using the Python programming language. Emphasis is placed on problem-solving using computational techniques, creating algorithms and designing classes.

In this assignment, I implemented a text-based version of the classic Sudoku puzzle. The Sudoku puzzle is set on a 9 × 9 board which is split into nine 3 × 3 squares. To achieve the goal of the puzzle, a player must use a process of elimination to fill in the remaining empty cells on the board, using only the digits 1 - 9, so that each row, column and 3 × 3 square only contain one of each digit.

This assignment is to create a Garden Gnome a single-player simulator game where a player must take care of house plants for 15 days. The player must keep more than half their plants alive for this duration. Items are rewarded throughout the day to assist the player and are applied when needed.

2048 is a single-player game where the player tries to construct a 2048 tile on a 4x4 grid . At any time each grid position is either empty or labelled with a power of two. Two random tiles are placed in random empty positions to initialize the game. Random tiles are usually 2’s but 4’s are occasionally possible. Each turn, the player moves all tiles up, down, left, or right, by pressing w, s, a, or d respectively. Tiles move in the chosen direction until they hit a wall or another tile. If a tile hits another tile with the same value the two tiles merge (in the direction of the move) into a single tile with twice the value. After this move, and before the next, a random tile is placed on a random empty board position. If the player constructs a 2048 tile they win and the game ends. If no more moves can be made
that would change the game state, the player loses and the game ends.
